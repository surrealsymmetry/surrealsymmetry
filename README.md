### Tracker

have had trouble making small games that fit between toy-example tests and full large scope ideas
scope of what i want to make exceeds ability
need to make small games with subsets of those systems only
so the current target is a minimum viable top-down game with *one* core system.
most large scope ideas i get interested in are top-down arpgs
so that should be the core of the first small game

#### Bullet-Heaven
clone / demake DRG:Survivors

- rogue arpg style builds (core system)
- basic terrain procgen
- trivial controls
- trivial enemy behaviour
- finite gameplay loop

while i dont want to get hung up on minutae of clever implementation, 
i make an exception for doing things in pure text instead of the Godot editor.

navigating Godot's native types in code helps me understand their structure.
pure procedural configuration and scene generation is an acceptable distraction.
within reason.
authoring scene files directly is the better option, but it is good to have a handle on the data structures as well.
